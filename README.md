# Recode PWA Boilerplate

This repo is a Progressive Web App boilerplate for the [ReCode](https://billythemusical.github.io/recode-fa22) class. It provides the most basic functionality for a PWA, complete with the following necesary files:
- a service worker (`sw.js`)
    - functions as a intermediator between your installed app and the website to manage what files are installed locally on the client machine and grabs new files as updates are made
- a manifest file (`manifest.json`) 
    - provides a list of the files and icons needed by the service worker along with other app-related metadata
    
All of the icon files are in the `images` folder. These are used for either the home screen icon on Android and iOS or the desktop application icon. They were created with [favicon.ico](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/). 

> NOTE: The a2hs installer fork of this repo provides functionality for an install button on the page, which augments the 'normal' intall process in the URL window.

# Install Instructions

In order for this web app to be installed, whether on your mobile device or desktop, you must serve the files via a server. This could be a local server or you could upload the files in this repo to a Neocities page.

1) To clone this repo, `cd` to your target directory and type `git clone` and the repo link, which is this page's URL. You can also download the zipped contents as well. 

2) Run a local server from inside of the downloaded folder, for example, using the "Go Live" button in VS Code with Live-Server extension installed.

3) Then in your Chrome browser (recommended), navigate to the `localhost` page in your browser, being careful to note the port number (5500 in the case of Live-Server extension). 

4) You should be able to install the app by clicking the "Install" icon in the URL window (see pic below).
