# Recode PWA Boilerplate

This repo is a Progressive Web App boilerplate for the [ReCode](https://billythemusical.github.io/recode-fa22) class. It provides the most basic functionality for a PWA, complete with a basic service worker, manifest, a favicon with home and touch screen icons (all from [favicon.ico](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)), and the ability to install from an HTML button.

To clone this repo, `cd` to your target directory and type `git clone` and the repo link in this page's URL. 

Then run a local server from that folder and navigate to the `localhost` page in your browser. From there, you should be able to install the app by clicking the "Install button on the page.
